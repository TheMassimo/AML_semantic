# Real-time Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation

Semantic segmentation in real-time is a very important task for image analysis. Over time, various techniques have been discovered and experimented with, leading to the need to apply segmentation from a source domain to a target domain that differ from each otherâ€”typically, the former being synthetic and the latter real-world data. Here, we will explore the possibility of performing semantic segmentation with domain adaptation, starting from a dataset of images from GTA5 and transitioning to a real-world image dataset like Cityscapes. Additionally, tools such as FDA will be introduced to enhance performance.
This repository houses the code for our project in the "Advanced Machine Learning" course at Politecnico di Torino.
